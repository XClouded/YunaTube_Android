      <div class="quote">"I'll never forget the night Korean figure skater Kim Yu-na became an Olympic legend. It's funny because, before the event, I dreaded covering it. I had never written about figure skating and wasn't sure I could describe what happened on a tight deadline. I am to figure skating what Shaquille O'Neal is to the Cleveland Cavaliers -- just an out-of-place misfit. But Kim made it easy for me. She was stunning -- elegant and athletic -- and turned the night (which included the courageous performance of a Canadian skater named Joannie Rochette who was mourning her mother's death) into hers. She looked superhuman during her free skate, and when she was finished with her masterful, gold-medal performance, she reminded us that she was a 19-year-old living the same dream that little girls around the world have. She cried, long and hard. She didn't know why she was crying, but she couldn't stop, either. I'll never forget the night Kim Yu-na became an Olympic legend. And I'll never fear covering figure skating again."</div>

      <div class="quote">"During the competition Ms. Kim transformed herself into two characters: a James Bond flirt, aiming an invisible gun at the audience in her short program, and a free spirit skating to Gershwin’s Concerto in F with relaxed aplomb in her long program. Moving with a steady swiftness, yet seeming to melt into the music at every opportunity — not easy in an ice rink, where musical notes can sound like rain hitting tin — Ms. Kim abandoned herself to speed and poise to attain a state of grace."</div>
